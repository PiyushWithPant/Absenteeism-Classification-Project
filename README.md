#### ML-driven Data Science project to classify whether an employee is moderately or excessively absent in the workplace.

### Libraries/Packages/Classes used :books:

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn import preprocessing

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn import metrics
import pickle
```

### Features of the project :black_nib:

- Algorithm :arrow_right: Logistic Regression
- Detailed Preprocessing of dataset.
- 2 dedicated jupyter notebooks for = Preprocessing and Modelling.
- Custom scaler
- Standardization
- Summary and analysis table
- Deployment ready but without class modification. <i>(This can be future work of the project to make it object-oriented for deployment.)</i>
